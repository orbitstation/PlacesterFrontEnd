PlacesterFrontEnd
=================
two page SPA - responsive layout

*dont miss the second page, click on the address in the tour section to get to it. 
 Its a template that demonstrates how the listings page could work. 

this is a demo front end for placester, it makes use of...
  Bootstrap  - for the responsive 12 coulmn layout 
  Backbone   - for its MVC framework and its router
  Underscore - for the templating engine 
  jQuery     - well just because its a dependancy 

  I also made use of a scrap of code from lynda.com, ("callBack()" in dataXXX.js) 
  this enables the use of local JSON in the JS file to be replaced later by an AJAX source.

I put in about 8 hours total, and I skiped the javascript menu on the home page, I dident 
have a clear picture of how it should function, and it looks as if there may have been a 
library function in mind when it was designed, ?maybe Jumbotron in bootstrap? So I put my
efforts into making the MVC/SPA code work, and then later into the second page, and its data source.
